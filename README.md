# Multi-Application Deployment with Docker Compose and Reverse Proxy
This repository provides the essential files for deploying multiple applications within a single AWS infrastructure using subdomains and a streamlined workflow.

# Contents:

•	docker-compose.yml: This file defines the Docker Compose services for each application. You'll need to modify it based on your specific application needs.
•	ReverseProxy: The configuration file for Nginx, acting as a reverse proxy, routing traffic to the respective containerized applications based on subdomains and paths.

# How it works:
1.	Application Containerization: Each application is packaged as a Docker image using a Dockerfile (not included in this repository, needs to be created separately). This ensures consistent environment across different development environments and deployment environments.
2.	Service Orchestration: docker-compose.yml orchestrates the different application containers along with any required resources (databases, caches, etc.). This ensures applications start in the correct order and interact seamlessly.
3.	Reverse Proxy and Routing: Nginx acts as a reverse proxy, receiving traffic for each subdomain and forwarding it to the relevant application container based on configured routes. nginx.conf is responsible for mapping subdomains to specific ports exposed by the Docker containers.
   
# Getting Started:
1.	Create your applications' Dockerfiles: You'll need separate Dockerfiles for each application. Refer to Docker documentation for instructions and examples.
2.	Update docker-compose.yml: Modify the services, ports, and network configurations to reflect your applications.
3.	Configure Nginx (in nginx.conf): Define subdomain-to-service routing rules to match your application requirements. Include your SSL certificate for https encryption.
4.	Deploy on AWS:
	    Provision an EC2 instance in the desired AWS region.
      Install Docker, Docker Compose, and Nginx on the EC2 instance.
	    Clone this repository onto the instance.
	    Configure the instance to auto-start and use an Elastic IP.
	    Set up a script to start the application using docker-compose up at the instance startup.

# Prerequisites:
•	Basic understanding of Docker and Docker Compose
•	Familiarity with AWS services like EC2, Route 53, and Elastic IPs
•	Experience with Nginx configuration (particularly reverse proxy setup)

# Notes:
•	This repository provides a basic foundation. Additional configurations like volume mounting for data persistence and load balancing might be required for more advanced deployments.
•	Remember to create proper security measures like restricting access, using secure communication, and implementing user authentication for each application.
This approach provides a flexible, scalable, and easy-to-manage solution for hosting multiple applications within a single AWS infrastructure. Feel free to modify and expand this framework to meet your specific deployment needs.
